                        My name is Pablo Le贸n, I currently reside in C贸rdoba, where I work as a Software Developer in Redsys. 
                        Passionate about web development and its application to improve the quality of life of people. 
                        I dedicate my free time to participate as Organizer in the Google Developers Group (GDG), organizing 
                        and giving talks about Programming and Technology, as well as in other local communities 
                        (Women TechMakers, Python C贸rdoba, PHP C贸rdoba ...). 
                        I like to stay in continuous learning and find ways to improve my work day by day.
